#+TITLE: Doom Emacs Basics

* /counsel-M-x/: =M-x= or =SPC :=

* Toggle /evil-emacs-state/: =C-z=
- Check /helpful-key/:
  + In Evil: =SPC h k= (/describe-key/)
  + Outside Evil: =C-h k=
- /counsel-describe-function/:
  + In Evil: =SPC h f= (/describe-function/)
  + Outside Evil: =C-h f=
- /counsel-describe-variable/:
  + In Evil: =SPC h v= (/describe-variable/)
  + Outside Evil: =C-h v=

* Find in Doom help: =SPC h d s=

* Whenever touched package settings: =doom sync=
- =doom sync -u= also updates packages
- After doom sync, do =M-x doom/reload=: =SPC h r r=
  + Sometimes this is not enough, so restart Emacs
what about modifying =init.el=, the file-templates?

* File
** Find file (open ivy): =SPC .=
- Move cursor up and down: =C-j= and =C-k=, or =C-n= and =C-p=
- Reveal alternative options: =C-o=
** Find file in project: =SPC SPC=
** File: =SPC f=
- Rename/move file: =SPC f R=
- Save file as...: =SPC f S=

* Buffer: =SPC b=
- Switch workspace buffer: =SPC b b= or =SPC ,=
- Switch buffer: =SPC b B= or =SPC <=
- Switch to last buffer: =SPC b l=
- Next/previous buffer: =SPC b n= and =SPC b p=
- New empty buffer: =SPC b N=
- Save buffer: =SPC b s=

* Frame
- /make-frame/: =SPC o f=
- /delete-frame/: =SPC q f=
- /doom/delete-frame-with-prompt/: =SPC q f=
- /+evil/next frame/: =] F=
- /+evil/previous frame/: =[ F=

* Window: =SPC w=
=C-w= also works, but =SPC w= is better
- Horizontal split: =SPC w s= or =:sp=
- Vertical split: =SPC w v= or =:vs=
- Close window: =SPC w c=

* Folding
- Rotate current subtree between states: =TAB=
- Rotate entire buffer between states: =S-TAB=
- close (fold) the trwn but not subtree: =M-S-j/k=

* Some advanced editing thanks to Evil Mode
- select an element: =vae=
- delete an element: =dae=
- select a subtree: =vaR=
- delete a subtree: =daR=
- yank a subtree: =yiR=

* other stuff
- Inside config.org (could be in =~/.doom.d=):
  + Do =C-c C-c= to refresh setup
  + Then do =M-x org-babel-tangle= to convert code blocks in org files.
