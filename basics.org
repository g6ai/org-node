#+TITLE: Org-mode Basics in Doom Emacs

* Basics of Doom Emacs
** /counsel-M-x/: =M-x= or =SPC :=
** Toggle /evil-emacs-state/: =C-z=
- Check /helpful-key/:
  + In Evil: =SPC h k=
  + Outside Evil: =C-h k=
** Find in Doom help: =SPC h d s=
** Whenever touched package settings: =doom sync=
=doom sync -u= also updates packages
After doom sync, do =M-x doom/reload=: =SPC h r r=
** File
*** Find file (open ivy): =SPC .=
- Move cursor up and down: =C-j= and =C-k=, or =C-n= and =C-p=
- Reveal alternative options: =C-o=
*** Find file in project: =SPC SPC=
*** File: =SPC f=
- Rename/move file: =SPC f R=
- Save file as...: =SPC f S=
** Buffer: =SPC b=
- Switch workspace buffer: =SPC b b= or =SPC ,=
- Switch buffer: =SPC b B= or =SPC <=
- Switch to last buffer: =SPC b l=
- Next/previous buffer: =SPC b n= and =SPC b p=
- New empty buffer: =SPC b N=
- Save buffer: =SPC b s=
** Frame
- /make-frame/: =SPC o f=
- /delete-frame/: =SPC q f=
- /doom/delete-frame-with-prompt/: =SPC q f=
- /+evil/next frame/: =] F=
- /+evil/previous frame/: =[ F=
** Window: =SPC w=
=C-w= also works, but =SPC w= is better
- Horizontal split: =SPC w s= or =:sp=
- Vertical split: =SPC w v= or =:vs=
- Close window: =SPC w c=
** Folding
- Rotate current subtree between states: =TAB=
- Rotate entire buffer between states: =S-TAB=
- close (fold) the trwn but not subtree: =M-S-j/k=

* Some advanced editing thanks to Evil Mode
- select an element: =vae=
- delete an element: =dae=
- select a subtree: =vaR=
- delete a subtree: =daR=
- yank a subtree: =yiR=

* The TODO list
** Example [1/2]
*** TODO ~TODO example one~
*** DONE ~DONE example two~
** To remove TODO: =S-LEFT=
** Open TODO state list: =SPC m t=
- mark as TODO: =SPC m t t=
** open org-schedule: =SPC m d s=
- Click on the date in the calendar.
- =S-ARROWS= to change the date of scheduled item.
- =S-ARROWS= also works for scheduled item in the org file.
** =RET= toggles TODO and DONE
** To create a checkbox: =- [ ]= [1/2] [50%]
- [-] one [1/3] [33%]
  - [ ] 1
  - [ ] 2
  - [X] 3
- [X] two
Tick/untick with =C-c C-c= or =SPC m x=. Use =RET= to rotate states.

* Org-agenda
** launch with =SPC o A= or =SPC o a a= or =SPC n a= or =M-x org-agenda= followed by...
- =a= = agenda for current week (things that are scheduled)
- =t= = list TODO items that are open (not done)
  + Inside the TODO view, you can simply hit =t= to change the state.
  + This also works inside the agenda view.
  + Outside of this view, you need to hit =SPC m t= to get the state list.
- =s= = search by keyword
  + You can use regex in the searches
** schedule
*** ~SCHEDULED: <... ++1d>~
Use this =++1d= to make it a daily recurring task.
*** ~SCHEDULED: <...>--<...>~
Use this to schedule tasks during this period.
** /org-agenda-file-to-front/: =C-c [=
** /org-remove-file/: =C-c ]=

* org-journal
- New Entry: =SPC n j j=
- New Scheduled Entry: =SPC n j J=

* other stuff
- Inside config.org (could be in =~/.doom.d=):
  + Do =C-c C-c= to refresh setup
  + Then do =M-x org-babel-tangle= to convert code blocks in org files.
- To timestamp the task when it's marked as done:
  + Add ~(setq org-log-done 'time)~ to config
  + Or use ~(setq org-log-done 'note)~ to add both timestamp and a note.
