#+TITLE: Magit Basics

/Note/: this is intended for Doom Emacs.

Magit: =SPC g=
* status buffer: =SPC g g=
** move cursor up / down one section: =C-k= / =C-j=
/magit-section-backward/ / /magit-section-forward/
** move cursor up / down one section on the same level: =[= / =]=
/magit-section-backward-sibling/ / /magit-section-forward-sibling/
** move cursor to a commit, then:
/dwim/ means 'do what I mean'
- diff popup: =d=
  + diff dwim: =d d=
- log popup: =l=
  + log dwim: =l l=
** move cursor to a hunk, then:
- stage: =s=
- unstage: =u=
- stage everything: =S=
- unstage everything: =U=
** select a region of changes or hunk (/set-mark-command/): =C-@=, =C-SPC= or =V= (in Doom Emacs)
=s= and =u= also work
** refresh diffs:
From https://emacsair.me/2017/09/01/magit-walk-through/, *Changing diff arguments* section:
Instead of using a hunk internal region to just stage parts of the hunk, you oculd also have told Git to make the hunks smaller using the =-U= argument.
To do so, press =-= until the hunk in question breaks up into two. Use =+= to do the opposite.
*** /magit-diff-less-context/: ===
This is remapped by Doom Emacs. The original key is =-=, see https://magit.vc/manual/magit/Refreshing-Diffs.html.
*** /magit-diff-more-context/: =+=
** commit popup: =c=
- create a regular new commit: =c c=
- reword: =c w=
- when done, press =C-c C-c=
** fetch popup: =f=
** pull popup: =F=
** push popup: =p= or =P=
- push: =p p=
- push with =--force=: =p - F p=
  + this could be useful when you've already pushed the commit to the remote and then did rewording.
** /magit-refresh/: =g r= or =g z=
/magit-refresh-all/: =g R=
** press =q= to quit status buffer
