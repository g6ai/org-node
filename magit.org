#+TITLE: Magit Basics

/Note/: this is intended for Doom Emacs.

Magit: =SPC g=
* status buffer: =SPC g g=
** move up / down one section: =[= / =]=
** move cursor to a commit, then:
/dwim/ means 'do what I mean'
- diff popup: =d=
  + diff dwim: =d d=
- log popup: =l=
  + log dwim: =l l=
** move cursor to a hunk, then:
- stage: =s=
- unstage: =u=
- stage everything: =S=
- unstage everything: =U=
** select a region of changes or hunk: =C-SPC=
=s= and =u= also work
** commit popup: =c=
- create a regular new commit: =c c=
- when done, press =C-c C-c=
- reword: =c w=
** fetch popup: =f=
** pull popup: =F=
** push popup: =p= or =P=
- push: =p p=
- push with =--force=: =p - F p=
  + this could be useful when you've already pushed the commit to the remote and then did rewording.
** press =q= to quit status buffer
