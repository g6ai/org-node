* 10 Capture and Attachments
** 10.1 Capture
*** 10.1.1 Setting up capture
=org-default-notes-file= value is originally set by =~/.emacs.d/.local/straight/repos/org/lisp/org.el=, then overridden by =~/.emacs.d/modules/lang/org/config.el=.
*** 10.1.2 Using capture
**** /org-capture/: =SPC X=
*** 10.1.3 Capture templates
=org-capture-templates= value is set by =~/.emacs.d/modules/lang/org/config.el=.

* 11 Agenda Views
** 11.1 Agenda Files
- /org-agenda-file-to-front/: =C-c [=
  + Move/add the current file to the top of the agenda file list.
- /org-remove-file/: =C-c ]=
  + Remove current file from the list of files in variable /org-agenda-files/.
** 11.2 The Agenda Dispatcher
launch with =M-x org-agenda= or =SPC o A= or =SPC o a a= or =SPC n a= (use this) followed by...
- =a= = agenda for current week (things that are scheduled)
- =t= = list TODO items that are open (not done)
  + Inside the TODO view, you can simply hit =t= to change the state.
  + This also works inside the agenda view.
  + Outside of this view, you need to hit =SPC m t= to get the state list.
- =s= = search by keyword
  + You can use regex in the searches

* 12 Markup for Rich contents
** 12.2 Emphasis and Monospace
- *bold*

** doomscript
it should be called =org-journal=, with execution privilege; and be executed by ~./org-journal arg_placeholder~.
#+begin_src elisp
#!/usr/bin/env doomscript

(defcli! org-journal (&args files)
  (require 'doom-start)
  (dolist (file files)
    (org-journal-new-entry t)
    (save-buffer)))

(run! "org-journal" (cdr (member "--" argv)))
#+end_src
  
* beorg
The quick capture has a default file =inbox.org=. I elect to not use it, but to use org-journal instead.
** org-journal template
- State: ~TODO~
- Subtree item: ~%(date->string (date-adjust (current-date) -5 'hours) "~A")%~
** beorg-journal shortcut
- The X-Callback URL looks like this, variables included (look at the the shortcut for definition): ~beorg://x-callback-url/capture?title=URL Encoded Text%20URL Encoded Text&notes=URL Encoded Text&file=journal%2FFormatted Date&template=org-journal&x-success=beorg://x-callback-url/file?file=journal%2FFormatted Date~
