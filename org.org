#+TITLE: Org

Organised as per The Org Manual

* Document Structure
** Visibility Cycling
*** Initial visibility
When Emacs first visits an Org file, the global state is set to =showeverything=. This can be configured through the variable =org-startup-folded=, or on a per-file basis by adding a =STARTUP= keyword to =overview=, =content=, =showall=, =showeverything= or =show<n>levels= (n = 2..5)

* Hyperlinks
** /org-toggle-link-display/: =SPC m l t=

* ~TODO~ Items
** Example [1/2]
*** TODO ~TODO example one~
*** DONE ~DONE example two~
** To remove TODO: =S-LEFT=
** Open TODO state list: =SPC m t=
- mark as TODO: =SPC m t t=
** =RET= toggles TODO and DONE
** To create a checkbox: =- [ ]= [1/2] [50%]
- [-] one [1/3] [33%]
  + [-] 1
  + [ ] 2
  + [X] 3
- [X] two
Tick/untick with =C-c C-c= or =SPC m x=. Use =RET= to rotate states.
** To timestamp the task when it's marked as done:
- Add ~(setq org-log-done 'time)~ to config
- Or use ~(setq org-log-done 'note)~ to add both timestamp and a note.

* Dates and Times
** /org-deadline/: =SPC m d d=
** /org-schedule/: =SPC m d s=
- Click on the date in the calendar.
- =S-ARROWS= to change the date of scheduled item.
- =S-ARROWS= also works for scheduled item in the org file.
*** schedule
**** ~SCHEDULED: <... ++1d>~
Use this =++1d= to make it a daily recurring task.
**** ~SCHEDULED: <...>--<...>~
Use this to schedule tasks during this period.

* Agenda Views
** launch with =SPC o A= or =SPC o a a= or =SPC n a= (use this) or =M-x org-agenda= followed by...
- =a= = agenda for current week (things that are scheduled)
- =t= = list TODO items that are open (not done)
  + Inside the TODO view, you can simply hit =t= to change the state.
  + This also works inside the agenda view.
  + Outside of this view, you need to hit =SPC m t= to get the state list.
- =s= = search by keyword
  + You can use regex in the searches
** Agenda file list
- /org-agenda-file-to-front/: =C-c [=
  + Move/add the current file to the top of the agenda file list.
- /org-remove-file/: =C-c ]=
  + Remove current file from the list of files in variable /org-agenda-files/.

* Markup for Rich contents
** Emphasis and Monospace
- *bold*
- /italic/
- _underlined_
- =verbatim=
- ~code~
- +strike-through+
Text in the code and verbatim string is not processed for Org specific syntax; it is exported verbatim.

* org-journal
- New Entry: =SPC n j j=
- New Scheduled Entry: =SPC n j J=

* Org-roam
** Org-roam-UI
/org-roam-ui-mode/
