** The Agenda Dispatcher
launch with =M-x org-agenda= or =SPC o A= or =SPC o a a= or =SPC n a= (use this) followed by...
- =a= = agenda for current week (things that are scheduled)
- =t= = list TODO items that are open (not done)
  + Inside the TODO view, you can simply hit =t= to change the state.
