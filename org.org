#+TITLE: Org

Organised as per The Org Manual

* Document Structure
** Visibility Cycling
*** Initial visibility
When Emacs first visits an Org file, the global state is set to =showeverything=. This can be configured through the variable =org-startup-folded=, or on a per-file basis by adding a =STARTUP= keyword to =overview=, =content=, =showall=, =showeverything= or =show<n>levels= (n = 2..5)

* Hyperlinks
** /org-toggle-link-display/: =SPC m l t=

* ~TODO~ Items
** Basic TODO Functionality
*** /org-todo/: =SPC m t=
- mark as TODO: =SPC m t t=
*** To remove TODO: =S-LEFT=
*** =RET= toggles TODO and DONE
** Progress Logging
*** Closing items
- Add ~(setq org-log-done 'time)~ to config
- Or use ~(setq org-log-done 'note)~ to add both timestamp and a note.
** Breaking Down Tasks into Subtasks [1/2] [50%]
*** TODO ~TODO example one~
*** DONE ~DONE example two~
** Checkboxes
- [-] one [1/3] [33%]
  + [-] 1
  + [ ] 2
  + [X] 3
- [X] two
*** /org-toggle-checkbox/: =C-c C-c= or =SPC m x= 
*** =RET= rotates states

* Dates and Times
** Timestamps
Available formats:
- ~<2003-09-16 Tue>~
- ~<2003-09-16 Tue 09:39>~ 
- ~<2003-09-16 Tue 12:00-12:30>~
*** Plain timestamp
<2003-09-16 Tue 09:39> 
*** Timestamp with repeater interval
<2003-09-16 Tue 09:39 +1d> 
*** Diary-style expression entries
*** Time/Date range
<2003-09-16 Tue 09:39>--<2003-09-16 Tue 10:00> 
*** Inactive timestamp
[2003-09-16 Tue 09:39] 
** Deadlines and Scheduling
- ~SCHEDULED: <2003-09-16 Tue 09:39>~
- ~SCHEDULED: <2003-09-16 Tue 09:39>--<2003-09-16 Tue 10:00>~
*** Inserting deadlines or schedules
**** /org-deadline/: =SPC m d d=
**** /org-schedule/: =SPC m d s=
- Click on the date in the calendar.
- =S-ARROWS= to change the date of scheduled item.
- =S-ARROWS= also works for scheduled item in the org file.
*** Repeated tasks
- ~SCHEDULED: <2003-09-16 Tue 09:39 ++1d>~
Use this =++1d= to make it a daily recurring task.

* Agenda Views
** Agenda Files
- /org-agenda-file-to-front/: =C-c [=
  + Move/add the current file to the top of the agenda file list.
- /org-remove-file/: =C-c ]=
  + Remove current file from the list of files in variable /org-agenda-files/.
** The Agenda Dispatcher
launch with =M-x org-agenda= or =SPC o A= or =SPC o a a= or =SPC n a= (use this) followed by...
- =a= = agenda for current week (things that are scheduled)
- =t= = list TODO items that are open (not done)
  + Inside the TODO view, you can simply hit =t= to change the state.
  + This also works inside the agenda view.
  + Outside of this view, you need to hit =SPC m t= to get the state list.
- =s= = search by keyword
  + You can use regex in the searches

* Markup for Rich contents
** Emphasis and Monospace
- *bold*
- /italic/
- _underlined_
- =verbatim=
- ~code~
- +strike-through+
Text in the code and verbatim string is not processed for Org specific syntax; it is exported verbatim.
** Special Symbols
- /org-toggle-pretty-entities/: =C-c C-x \=, I set it to =SPC \=

* Worg
- [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-symbols.html][Symbols in Org-mode]]

- New Scheduled Entry: =SPC n j J=
